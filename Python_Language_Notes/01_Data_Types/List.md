List :Collection of Homogeneous Data declared between Square Brackets and values are separated by commas.

l=[12,22,11,"Ram",True]


variable space l = 0X21 and value space 12->0/-5 , 22- > 1/-4, .....


   
append() -> to add some value to list
remove() -> to remove some value from list

pop() -> to remove last value from list and syntax is: var.pop(index)

Tuples :Homogenous collection of values enclosed in () and seperated by commas  and it is immutable (cannot be changed once declared)

 syntax : var(11,2,21,'',True)
  default value of tuple is ()

Modification in list 
to add any value in list at any particular place s[n][m] where n is ..... and m is ...... 
to remove any value


take any example of any list and find find index and then second index of any values present mode then 2 times suppose 

Sets: It is a collection of homogenous values enclosed in curly {} braces
 it is suitable collection of immutable data type
 Set is unordered it does not accept duplicate values 

we can't do indexing in set

Dictionary It is collection of key and velue pair enclosed between curly braces and values and keys are seperated by colon' : ' 
 no indexing will there in dictionary 
 it is unordered collection
 it have values are accessible through key only 
 eg; d= {1:'e', 'g': 3}
  the value is known as hidden layer because we can access through values only 


if we take multiple values of single key in different places it will over ride and give last value 
type casting :
d={1:'e', 'g': 3}
// conversion into list
list(d) -> it will give error or not?


Slicing : If we are picking some part or particular part then it is called slicing
    ~Syntax ~ : Var_name[Starting_index][Ending_index][Step]

    Starting_index always inclusive in excluded part
