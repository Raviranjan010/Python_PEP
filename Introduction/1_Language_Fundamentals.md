# Introduction to Programming Languages

## What is a Programming Language?
A **programming language** is a formal, constructed language used to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute to perform specific tasks. It acts as a bridge between human logic and machine execution.

## Types of Programming Languages
Programming languages are broadly classified into three categories based on their abstraction level (how close they are to the hardware):

### 1. Low-Level Programming Languages
These are closest to the machine hardware. They provide direct control over system resources but are difficult for humans to read and write.

*   **Machine Language (1st Generation)**:
    *   Consists of binary code (`0`s and `1`s).
    *   Directly understood by the CPU.
    *   **Pros**: Extremely fast execution.
    *   **Cons**: Very difficult to learn and debug; machine-dependent (code written for one CPU architecture might not work on another).
    *   *Example*: `10101010 11001001`

*   **Assembly Language (2nd Generation)**:
    *   Uses **mnemonics** (symbolic codes) instead of raw binary.
    *   Requires an **Assembler** to convert it into key machine code.
    *   **Pros**: Easier than machine language; allows hardware manipulation.
    *   **Cons**: Still complex and hardware-dependent.
    *   *Example*:
        ```assembly
        MOV A, B   ; Move data from B to A
        ADD A, 5   ; Add 5 to A
        ```

### 2. Mid-Level Programming Languages
These combine features of both low-level (hardware access) and high-level (abstraction) languages.

*   **Example**: **C Language**.
*   **Why?**:
    *   It allows low-level memory manipulation using **pointers**.
    *   It supports high-level structured programming concepts (functions, loops).

### 3. High-Level Programming Languages
Designed to be user-friendly and abstract away the complex hardware details.

*   **Features**:
    *   English-like syntax (easy to read and write).
    *   **Machine Independent** (Portable): Code runs on any system with the appropriate compiler/interpreter.
    *   Easy debugging and maintenance.
*   **Examples**: **Python**, Java, C++, JavaScript.
*   *Example (Python)*:
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

## Comparison Summary

| Feature | Low-Level | Mid-Level | High-Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hardware Dependency** | High (Machine Dependent) | Partial | None (Portable) |
| **Human Readability** | Low (Binary/Mnemonics) | Medium | High (English-like) |
| **Execution Speed** | Very High | High | Moderate (due to translation) |
| **Translation** | Assembler (for Assembly) | Compiler | Interpreter / Compiler |
| **Examples** | Machine Code, Assembly | C | Python, Java, JS |
